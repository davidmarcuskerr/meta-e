				<h3>What we do</h3>
				<h4>If it happens in discovery, we have already done it, and done it well.</h4>
				<p>Discovery has become so expensive because there is so much data and opposing sides often don't know how to vigorously defend their clients yet work cooperatively. We help you hone in on what you need to be competitive yet collaborative, using our knowledge to your advantage.</p>
